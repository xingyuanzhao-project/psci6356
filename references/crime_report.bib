	abstract = {We show that the demand for news varies with the perceived affinity of the news organization to the consumer’s political preferences. In an experimental setting, conservatives and Republicans preferred to read news reports attributed to Fox News and to avoid news from {CNN} and {NPR}. Democrats and liberals exhibited exactly the opposite syndrome—dividing their attention equally between {CNN} and {NPR}, but avoiding Fox News. This pattern of selective exposure based on partisan affinity held not only for news coverage of controversial issues but also for relatively “soft” subjects such as crime and travel. The tendency to select news based on anticipated agreement was also strengthened among more politically engaged partisans. Overall, these results suggest that the further proliferation of new media and enhanced media choices may contribute to the further polarization of the news audience.},

This article examines the influence of news media partisanship on the coverage of the controversial artificial intelligence ({AI}) technology facial recognition. A mixed-methods content analysis of news articles (N = 451) from 23 {US}-based news outlets highlights the emergence of several frames in coverage of facial recognition pertaining to issues of privacy and surveillance, bias, technology’s ability to provide solutions, and its problematic development and implementation. Coverage was differentiated by partisanship, whereby left-leaning media focused more on ethical problems associated with the technology compared to their right-leaning peers who highlighted its abuses by foreign governments. Right-leaning media also referred more to technology’s positive uses, such as helping law enforcement, compared to left-leaning media. Finally, {AI} companies were the most dominant suppliers of information to the media regarding the technology.},

The {LIB} suggests that people use more abstract language to describe stereotype-congruent behaviors, particularly when that person is a member of an out-group. This study of 208 White adults manipulates the race of a suspect in a {TV} news crime story and examines how race influences the abstractness of the language viewers use to describe the suspect. The findings offer support for the {LIB} being induced by crime news and show that news media use is significantly related to the presence of the {LIB}.

The first study analyzes national survey data to identify the factors that lead political partisans to choose particular cable television news networks and programs. The second study employs experimental methods to demonstrate how viewers’ partisan leanings influence their perceptions of content from {CNN}, Fox News, and The Daily Show. We found evidence of a relative hostile media phenomenon, in which partisans perceive more bias in programs that do not align with their own political perspective.

A comparative analysis of news attention to verified features of events across partisan news outlets provides opportunities to understand the news values driving coverage in each of these venues. To examine these relationships, we conducted time-series analyses using a unique data set of 59 mass shooting events coded for characteristics of victims, shooters, and context, contrasted with coverage in six major news outlets during 2012–2014. We found that, although certain factors drive news coverage of gun violence, gun rights, and gun control across the ideological spectrum, differential patterns emerge based on contextual particularities. Across all news media, a higher number of non-Black victims drove up coverage. For moderate and conservative news media, a higher number of Black},
