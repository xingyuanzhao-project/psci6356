Thanks for a great presentation! I'm looking forward to reading the final draft of the paper. Detailed feedback based on the elements of the rubric below.

1. Argument and Contribution: Does the presentation clearly state the research question and central argument, explaining why the question is important to political science and situating the work in the broader scholarly literature?

This section of the presentation was good, but could have been laid out a little more clearly. You say your research question is “How does political leaders’ messaging generate biased narratives to enable democratic backsliding?” which makes it sound like you are going to be diving deep into the mechanisms through which biased narratives emerge. But your actual study is less looking at the how, and more just showing that this messaging does lead to biased narratives emerging. So the research question is more: “Do political leaders’ public messaging significantly bias media coverage?” Focusing the question will help prepare your audience so that they are clearly prepared to know what you are going to present on.




2. Theory and Research Design: Is the theory presented logically coherent and offer a reasonable answer to the research question? Do the hypotheses flow from the theory? Is the research design informed by the theory and appropriate to answer the question?

This section was also great! I would have liked to see a little more detailed development of the theory and perhaps a slight abbreviation of the research design. For instance, I enjoyed the sharing of the LLM prompts that you included, but I would relegate this to an appendix if asked, rather than in the main presentation such that you can spend more time on theory (and also have more time for results)

The research design itself was very well put-together and an excellent way of addressing this question!




3. Analysis and Interpetation: Does the analysis logically follow from the evidence presented? Does the presentation draw out meaningful implications or conclusions?

The analysis as presented was a little unclear, though appropriate for early-stage work.




4. Professionalism and Presentation Style: Does the presenter speak clearly, at an appropriate pace, and with confidence? Are visual aids clear, readable and professional? Did the presentation stay within the allotted time?

You had excellent presentation speaking style, and managed your time well, though as mentioned above I would have liked to see a little more time on the results.

The visualizations were a problem – too small for the audience to be able to see clearly and difficult to interpret. I would recommend a single plot, make sure text is large, and that the implications that you are trying to draw out are being clearly communicated.




5. Discussant Consideration: Was the paper draft submitted to the discussant sufficiently complete to offer opportunities for meaningful feedback?  

Yes! You submitted a great draft to your discussant.

1. Does the proposal focus on a single research question that is empirical, answerable, and generalizable? Is the research question clearly expressed?

Yes, you clearly express your research question, and it is empirical, answerable, and generalizable. Well done!

 

2. Does the proposal engage with the academic literature on this question in a way that clearly lays out what scholarship has been previously done on this topic and why additional research is necessary?

The literature review is well laid-out for this stage, and engages with several relevant areas to clearly lay out why additional research is necessary. In particular I appreciates the engagement with Carothers and Hartnett as a way of framing the puzzle of how democratic backsliding occurs even when objective conditions are going well.

In the final paper, I’ll want to see literature review expanded somewhat, as there are only a couple of studies cited (in particular on media bias) and there is much more out there on these questions, but this is a good start.

 

3.  Does the proposal include an initial theory that proposes an answer to the research question? Is that theory logically coherent and show evidence of careful thinking? Does it build on the academic literature that the proposal engages with?

This is not very well-developed in your proposal (just a couple of sentences). Why do partisan media respond to leaders’ strategic communications? And is this systematically related democratic backsliding or is it just a general phenomenon of leaders attempting to shape public narratives?

I would also like to see more clear specification of all the terms described here. What kinds of performance are you examining? Is it national-level performance, the performance of ideological opponents, etc…? Or is it just support for particular anti-democratic policies?

 

4. Does the proposal include initial thoughts on testable hypotheses that would reasonably allow us to determine if the theory is true? Do the hypotheses flow logically from the theory and exclude alternative explanations?

Yes, you have two hypotheses laid out. The theory behind these could be clearer, but these are a good start. You should revise hypothesis 2, since you include a theoretical mechanism here that you won’t actually be testing. Testable hypotheses shouldn’t be where you specify untested mechanisms.

5. Does the proposal include an initial proposed research design for testing the hypotheses?

Yes, you’ve got a good start here. I mentioned this in-class, but a key question is going to be how to operationalize the dependent variable. What exactly is the gap here? Is it the difference in absolute number of articles vs absolute number of crimes? Is it population-weighted?

I have some questions about the cross-national design as well. Media bias is likely to be a consequence of democratic backsliding, as well as a potential cause, so you will have to carefully specify the model to avoid obvious confounding from reverse causality. I would recommend that you follow the Coppedge et al book and focus on democratic downturns as the DV, rather than levels. Control for lagged democracy should get you pretty far towards a more convincing model as well. You’ll probably want country fixed effects, not regional fixed effects, as well.

 

6. Does the presentation clearly and concisely summarize the proposal? Are the questions that the student proposes for how to improve their proposal and turn it into a paper well-thought out and evidence careful attention to the research project?

Yes, you gave a good presentation, especially for being the last one of the evening!
