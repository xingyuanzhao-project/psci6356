## Research Question

How does political leaders' messaging generate biased narratives to enable democratic backsliding?

- Trump calling out Democratic cities for high crime

- Gaps between actual crime data and the narratives

## Literature Review

**Media Bias:**

- Strong consensus on bias in "hard news" and politicized issues (Niven 1999; Niven 2001)
- Older research: less severe in "soft news" and objective topics (Niven 1999; Niven 2001)
- Partisan consumption patterns persist across all news types (Iyengar and Hahn 2009)
- Elites now directly contest objective data via social media (The White House 2025)

---

**Democratic Backsliding & Performance:**

- Better performance $\rightarrow$ more stable regimes (Carothers and Hartnett 2024)
- BUT: limited evidence that poor actual performance $\rightarrow$ democratic backsliding (Carothers and Hartnett 2024)
- Mixed cases: Brazil (Hunter and Power 2019), El Salvador (Economist 2019) vs. India (Sridharan 2014), Mexico (Sánchez-Talanquer and Greene 2021), Poland, Turkey (Carothers and Hartnett 2024)
- Voters embrace disruptive change promises (Carothers and Hartnett 2024)

## Main Argument

Political leaders social media posts -> biased media coverage -> perceived performance -> support for drastic changes -> **democratic backsliding**


**Contributions:**

- Mechanism: elite rhetoric actively shapes information environments

---


## Data Sources

**Crime Data:**
- FBI Crime Data Explorer (actual crime rates across U.S. cities/states)

**Population Data:**
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (state-level population for rate calculations)

**Media Coverage:**
- The News APIs (systematic collection, partisan comparison)

**Presidential Communications:**
- Truth Social posts (intervention timing)

---

## Data Generation

**News Reports Processing:**

- Scraped news reports from CNN and Fox News APIs.
- Used LLM (llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M) to classify filter,and annotate the news reports, created a regional crimenews reports dataset.

**Prompts Example:**

**Model 1 - Relevance Classification:**
```python
response_relevance = ollama.chat(
    model=model_name,
    messages=[{
        'role': 'user',
        'content': f'Is this text about crime in a US location? 
                    Respond in JSON format: 
                    {{"relevance": true}} or {{"relevance": false}}
                    
                    Text: {text}'
    }],
    format='json'
)
```

---

**Model 2 - Location Annotation:**
```python
response_location = ollama.chat(
    model=model_name,
    messages=[{
        'role': 'user',
        'content': f'Identify the exact US STATE mentioned in this text. 
                    If no state is mentioned, respond with "None". 
                    If the region is subnational, respond with the 
                    two digit state code. 
                    Respond in JSON format: 
                    {{"location": "two digit state code"}}
                    
                    Text: {text}'
    }],
    format='json'
)

## Methodology

**Doubly-Robust Difference-in-Differences (DRDID):**

$$
ATT_{DR} = \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\frac{G}{\mathbb{E}[G]} - \frac{\frac{p(X)(1-G)}{1-p(X)}}{\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{p(X)(1-G)}{1-p(X)}\right]}\right)(Y_1 - Y_0 - m(0,X))\right]
$$

where $G$ = treatment indicator, $p(X)$ = propensity score, $m(0,X)$ = outcome model

---

**Propensity Score Formula:**
$$
p(X) = P(G=1|X) = \frac{\exp(\gamma_0 + \gamma X)}{1 + \exp(\gamma_0 + \gamma X)}
$$

**Outcome Model (Improved Estimator):**
$$
m(0,t,X) = \mathbb{E}[\Delta Y_{it} | D=0, X_i] = \alpha_0 + \beta X
$$
where $\Delta Y_{it} = Y_{it} - Y_{i,t-1}$ (change in outcome from pre to post)

------

**Variables:**

- Outcome ($Y$): News frequency (monthly article count)
- Treatment ($G$): Indicator for DC (treated 2025/08) or IL (treated 2025/09)
- Time periods: 2 periods, pre-treatment and post-treatment
- Covariates ($X$): Crime rate (in covariate-adjusted model)

---

**Callaway & Sant'Anna Difference-in-Differences (CSDID):**

$$
ATT(g,t) = \mathbb{E}[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | G_g = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | C = 1]
$$

$$
ATT_{dynamic}(e) = \sum_{g} \frac{P(G=g)}{\sum_{g} P(G=g)} \cdot ATT(g, g+e)
$$

where $ATT(g,t)$ = average treatment effect for group first treated at time $g$ in period $t$, $e$ = event time, $C$ = never-treated control group, $P(G=g)$ = proportion of units in treatment group $g$

---

**Variables:**

- Outcome ($Y$): Valid News frequency at region-time (monthly article count)  
- Treatment groups ($g$): $g=202508$ (DC), $g=202509$ (IL)
- Control group ($C$): Never-treated states (49 states)
- Time periods ($t$): 2025/01-2025/10
- Covariates ($X$): Crime rate per 100,000 population (in covariate-adjusted model)
- ATT(g,t) Estimation method: drdid
- Aggregation: Dynamic event study ($e \in [-12, 10]$)

## Conclusion

- Presidential rhetoric significantly increased regional crime news coverage from aligned partisan media outlets: 

DC (2025/08) and IL (2025/09) experienced 100+ additional monthly articles post-intervention

- HonestDiD sensitivity analysis confirms results remain robust to violations of parallel trends assumption up to twice the baseline magnitude. 

---

## Limitations

- Data collection is limited to CNN and Fox News, and the news reports are not comprehensive.
- The CNN news are not completely collected, due to the limited funding available.
- Treated states are too few, only 2 states, DC and IL, making csdid results less reliable.

---

## Future Research

- Collect more news reports from more media outlets, and more states.
- Use more LLM pipelines to classify the support for the president's rhetoric
- Use fine-tuned models to get the bias level of the news reports.
- add pre treatment parallel trends assumption test. (event study)
  - there is one e=-1 has significant effect, indicates maybe there is some reverse causality: trump utilized existing media bias and increased it.
- investigage reverse causality:
media bias -> political leaders' messaging

democratic backsliding -> media bias and political leaders' messaging
