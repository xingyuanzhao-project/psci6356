## Motivation

President Trump calling out cities for high crime rates and deploying national guard to those cities to combat crime.

## Discrepancy

However, the actual crime rate tells a different story.

## Literature Review

It is already established that media bias exists:

- Strong consensus on bias in "hard news" and politicized issues
- Older research: less severe in "soft news" and objective topics
- Partisan consumption patterns persist across all news types

---

## Literature Review (cont.)

- **Question:** But how exactly do political leaders generate biased narratives to enable democratic backsliding?

- Better socioeconomic performance indeed provides more stable regimes,

- But evidence that lack of such performance causes democratic backsliding remains limited.

- Backsliding leaders win elections when voters embrace the promise of disruptive changes

---

## Main Argument

Political leaders social media posts -> biased media coverage -> perceived performance -> support for drastic changes -> democratic backsliding

---

## Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1: Political leaders' strategic communications increase the gap between actual and perceived performance.

Hypothesis 2: Media bias that distorts reality, creating more support for disruptive changes, enables democratic backsliding.

---

## Test 1

- **Unit of analysis:** State-time
- **Dependent variable:** Media bias: the difference between the actual crime rate and media coverage of the same crime type in a period of time
- **Intervention:** Trump Truth Social posts
- **Model:** Difference-in-differences with first treatment group dummy, relative time from the intervention, and state and temporal fixed effects.
- **Expected outcome:** Political leaders incite biased media coverage to achieve their own goals


---

## Test 2

- **Unit of analysis:** Country-time
- **DV:** Democratic Backsliding
- **IV:** Media Bias, from HuggingFace and UnBIAS Classification Bert
- **Model:** Linear regression model
- **Expected outcome:** Media bias distorting reality reduces support for democracy
